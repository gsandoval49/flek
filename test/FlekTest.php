/**
 * Abstract class containing universal and project specific mySQL parameters
 *
 * This class is designed to lay the foundation of the unit tests per project. It loads all the database parameters about the project so that table specifc tests can share the parameters in on place. To use it:
 *
 * 1. Rename the class from DataDesignTest to a project specific name (e.g., ProjectNameTest)
 * 2. Modify DataDesignTest::getDataSet() to include all the tables in your project
 * 3. Modity DataDesignTest::getConnection() to include the correct mySQL properties file.
 * 4. Have all table specific tests include this class.
 *
 * *NOTE*: Tables must be added in the order they were created in step (2).
